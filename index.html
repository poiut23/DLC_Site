          <h2><em>MY IIT TEAM TWINE GAME DEVELOPMENT</em></h2>
          <p> As a member of my game development team working on a Twine game, I've played a key role in shaping the player’s experience within the haunted museum setting. I’ve contributed by brainstorming how the main character will navigate the museum, outlining both the beginning and ending of the game, and crafting dialogue for the ghosts the player encounters. Additionally, I helped design the appearance of some of these ghosts and came up with ideas for the various creatures, monsters, and items that the player will discover along the way. My input also extended to how the museum’s atmosphere should feel, ensuring that the text immerses the player in its eerie, mysterious world.&#169;</p>

<p>Through collaboration with the team, I’ve helped bring the museum and its inhabitants to life by focusing on the small details that enhance the narrative. Whether it’s deciding on key gameplay elements or contributing to the overall look and feel of the setting, I’ve worked to ensure that the world we create feels cohesive and engaging for players.&#169;</P>
</div>
    <h3><strong> Below is the list of dialogue of different authors that was made by me for my team twine game</strong></h3>

   <ol>
      <li><strong>W.E.B Du Bois:</strong>

<br>“Well, hello there, little one. I see you’ve got your eyes on my silver key, don’t you? But I’m not just going to hand it over! No, first you’ll have to learn a few things about me.</br>

<br>My name is W.E.B. Du Bois, and I was one of the most influential Black protest leaders in the United States—at least if it’s still 1959... But let’s go back to 1897, the year I was offered a position by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. My task was to study Black households in places like Farmville, Virginia, Alabama, and Georgia. I conducted these studies to show the world how the legacy of slavery had left deep scars, making life for African Americans difficult and harmful.</br>

<br>No one outside my family, friends, or fellow professors knew just how serious I was about this topic. Not until I wrote my essay 'The Strivings of the Negro People' in 1897. That essay—my essay—opened the eyes of white readers, pulling them into the daily reality of Black folks living under the heavy weight of racism. Every. Single. Day. I mean, back then, a Black man couldn’t even use a white toilet without fearing a swarm of white cops rushing in to beat the life out of him”</br></li>
      <li><strong>Getrude stein:</strong> 

<br>"Ugh! Where is it? Where did I put my book…?"
She rustles through another pile before turning toward a stack near the door the kid just walked through. Suddenly, she notices the kid and straightens up, a surprised but amused grin crossing her face."</br>

<br>"Oh! Well, hello there. I wasn’t expecting a living person in this haunted house of authors."</br>

<br>She crosses her arms casually, clearly entertained.</br>

<br>"And if you're here, I suppose you're trying to reach the main room. That’s the only way out once you’re inside, you know. But to get there, you’ll need all the silver keys."
She pauses thoughtfully, then smiles mischievously.</br>

<br>"Hmm. Let’s make a deal. I’ll give you my key, but only if you learn a few things about me first.
I’m Gertrude Stein—a professional poet, author, and art collector, if you please. I was born in Pennsylvania and graduated from Radnor High School, then went on to Bryn Mawr College.
Very prestigious for women, by the way. Exhausting but fun…Anyway, I’ve done all sorts of things. I wrote a little book called The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. But here’s the twist—I wrote it about myself, only I pretended someone else was telling the story. Clever, right?"</br>

<br>"Anywho, I don't want to ramble on and sound too full of myself. I think you've heard enough of my musings."</br>

<br>She pulls a silver key from her pocket and hands it to the kid.</br>

<br>"Here’s my key. But before you go, remember this: sometimes, the search for answers leads you nowhere, and that’s the point. 'No answers, no easy paths—just the questions we live by.' Now, off you go!"</br></li>
       <li><strong>Mary Rowlandson:</strong>

<br>The kid walks into the dusty, dimly lit room of the haunted museum, drawn to an old book sitting on a pedestal. Its title reads, “The Life and Trials of Mary Rowlandson.” Hesitantly, the kid opens it, and suddenly, a cold gust sweeps through the room. Pages flip on their own as mist rises from the book, swirling and forming into the shape of a woman.</br>

<br>"Well, well… who dares to read my story? I haven’t seen the living in quite some time. A child? In a place like this? You must be trying to find a way out, aren’t you?"</br>

<br>She gestures to a silver key that glimmers faintly at her side.</br>

<br>"Ah, I see. You’ll need this key to escape. But nothing comes freely, especially in this museum. I’ll give it to you… if you learn who I am. My name is Mary Rowlandson. Long ago, I lived during a time of great hardship, when war between settlers and Native Americans broke out. I was taken captive, held for 11 long weeks, and yet I survived. Through it all, my faith in God was my guide. I wrote my story down in a book—it became the first of its kind, a tale of survival, struggle, and resilience. You’ve opened that very book now, and so you’ve called me here. I’ll tell you this: I faced the unimaginable and came out stronger for it. Now, you, too, must show strength by learning about the past. Understand who we were, and you’ll hold the key to moving forward."</br>

<br>She reaches out, handing the silver key to the child.</br>

<br>"Here. Take the key. But remember my story—it’s more than just words on a page. It’s a lesson. Now go, before the other spirits awaken."</br></li>
 
        <li><strong>Herman Melivlle:</strong>

<br>Mist seeps through the cracks of the door as the child steps into the cabin-like room, moving slowly through the thick, moist air. A dense fog swirls around them, and they tiptoe deeper inside, the atmosphere growing colder with each step. They can barely see ten paces ahead, but the distant sound of waves crashing becomes louder, echoing through the eerie stillness.</br>

<br>Suddenly, the child notices a faint, ocean-blue glow emerging from the mist. As they approach, the glow sharpens into the outline of a book, radiating with the melodic sounds of whale songs and waves crashing on a distant shore. Intrigued, they lift the book gently, its cover shimmering under the strange light. The title reads, Moby-Dick.
The moment the child cracks open the cover, the book springs to life. A surge of mist erupts from the pages, swirling and twisting until it takes the form of a ghostly figure—a man. He stretches his arms wide, yawning as if awakening from a long slumber. His face lights up with a gleeful, almost mischievous expression as his gaze locks onto the child.
The ghostly figure grins, his voice booming with a playful energy.</br>

<br>"HELLO! Didn’t your parents teach you it’s rude to wake up your elders?"</br>

<br>He lets out a hearty laugh that seems to echo through the mist.</br>

<br>"Hahaha, no matter!"
He straightens his ghostly form with a dramatic flair, tipping an invisible hat.</br>

<br>"My name is Herman Melville, one of the greatest authors in history, if I do say so myself."</br>

<br>His eyes twinkle with pride as he glances down at the Moby-Dick book in the child’s hands.</br>

<br>"A human like you doesn’t belong here—unless you’ve got plans to become a ghost too. You’re after something, aren’t you? Let me guess… a silver key, perhaps? I’ll give you my key, but first—you must learn a few things about me.</br> 

<br>"I wrote one of the greatest sea adventures of all time Moby-Dick. It’s about a mad captain hunting a white whale, but it’s also about obsession, fate, and a whole lot of danger. Took me years to write, and guess what? No one cared much for it at the time! But now? It’s a masterpiece! Shows how things can change after you’re gone... I wasn’t just an author of sea tales though. I worked on whaling ships myself. Saw the world from the deck of a ship, felt the salt in my beard—lived the adventure before I wrote it. And here’s the fun part—some say my book’s more about chasing meaning in life than chasing a whale. But that’s for you to decide. Now, Take the key, kid. But remember: every adventure has a price. Make sure you’re ready to face yours and learn from it…goodbye kid"</br>

<br>He flips the silver key into the air, catching it effortlessly before handing it to the child,
his form begins to fade into the mist.</br>
</li>
        <li><strong>Kurt Vonnegut:</strong> 

<br>The child steps into a room cluttered with strange diagrams and books, the air thick with a mix of cigarette smoke and musty paper. A book titled Slaughterhouse-Five sits on a rickety table. As the child reaches for it, a burst of smoke swirls up, taking the shape of an older man with a wild mop of hair, a sly grin on his face.</br>

 <br>"Well, look at that. Someone still reads books in this day and age. You’ve got guts kid. Name’s Kurt Vonnegut. I’ve been called a novelist, satirist, even a pessimist at times—depends on who you ask. You might know me from Slaughterhouse-Five. That’s the one where I blend World War II, time travel, and aliens all in one go. Sounds crazy, right? But it’s really about the absurdity of war and how humans are stuck in patterns we can’t escape. I wasn’t just a writer though. I was a soldier, too—saw Dresden burn during the war. That’s what Slaughterhouse-Five is really about—surviving that horror and wondering how the world can be so cruel and so ridiculous at the same time."</br>

 <br>He pulls a silver key from his ghostly coat pocket and hands it to the child, a thoughtful smile crossing his face.</br>

 <br>"Take the key kid. But remember this Life’s weird, messy, and doesn’t make sense half the time. But hey, what else can you do but keep going?"</br>
